Hello and welcome to my Github. I am a developer and creator based out of the Pacific Northwest. :evergreen_tree::mountain_snow:
</br>I have a lot of interests when it comes to programming, but the bottom line is- I just enjoy making things. 

Here you'll find a collection of both academic and self-learning projects based off my personal interests.

For a quick look into some of my latest and personal favorites, check out the projects below!

### Featured Picks
:brain: [Mini Quest Academy](https://github.com/MMdevworks/project_spell)
</br>An educational concept and my latest in Unity, a mini project within a larger concept; which I plan to continue building and learning from.

:1234: [A C# Calculator](https://github.com/MMdevworks/Calculator_Winform)
</br>A compact simple calculator build in Winforms.

:ghost: [A Spooky Shooter](https://github.com/MMdevworks/game-01)
</br>My first Unity micro-game! Don't worry, it's not really spooky... unless you find bugs, then it's my nightmare.

:grin: [Project Slingshot](https://github.com/MMdevworks/slingshot)
</br>I had fun learning how to render lines in this one and working on my very primitive 3D asset making skills.

:muscle: [VR Gym](https://github.com/MMdevworks/vr-gym) 
</br>I love the gym so much, I guess I just wanted to build one in VR to exercise my brain. 

:robot: [Arduino Uno Collection](https://github.com/MMdevworks/arduino-uno) 
</br>Just some small microcontroller projects, I love learning how code can work with hardware! One day I'll build a robot.
