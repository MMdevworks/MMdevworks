Hello and welcome to my Github. I am a developer and creator based out of the Pacific Northwest. :evergreen_tree::mountain_snow:
</br>I have a lot of interests when it comes to programming, but the bottom line is- I just enjoy making things. 

Here you'll find a collection of both academic and self-learning projects based off my personal interests.

For a quick look into some of my latest and personal favorites, check out the projects below!

### Featured Picks
:joystick: [Mini Quest Academy](https://github.com/MMdevworks/project_spell)
</br>An educational concept and my latest in Unity; which I plan to continue building and learning from.

:joystick: [A Spooky Shooter](https://github.com/MMdevworks/game-01)
